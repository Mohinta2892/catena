# Synful PyTorch and TensorFlow Usage

## PyTorch
This is under development. Currently at testing stage with `CREMI` and `FAFB` data.
We will soon release usage instructions.

## TensorFlow 
Please use this to run inference with `pretrained` models on your anisotropic datasets.
> [!WARNING]
> You can infer on `isotropic` datasets with these models, but beware that they are quite sensitive to the resolution and quality of the EM.
> Even with test data with matching resolutions with CREMI, the models may not be as accurate as expected.
> We will reveal our findings soon!
