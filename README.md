Catena provides a comprehensive workflow for automated connectome reconstruction based on SOTA Funke-lab pipelines for Neuron Segmentation `Local Shape Descriptors (Sheridan et al. 2022)`, Synapse Detection `Synful (Buhmann et al. 2020)`, Microtubule tracking `Micron (Eckstein et al. 2019)` and Neurotransmitter classification `Synister (Eckstein, Bates et al. 2024)` from large-scale volume Electron Microscopy (EM). To cope with the variability across EM datasets, Catena includes popular domain adaptation techniques tailored for EM-to-EM translation.

üõ†Ô∏è Features:
- Pytorch implementations of `LSDs` and `Synful`.
- Exploration of `LSDs` and `Synful` for other task objectives.
- Docker-based containerisation and release of development environments.
- Style transfer and domain adaptation with Generative AI models.
- Large scale data analysis over public and local EM datasets.
- Artefact logging with Weights and Biases.
