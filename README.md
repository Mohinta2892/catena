# Catena

This is an umbrella repository to store Funke-lab pipelines for Neuron Segmentation `Local Shape Descriptors (Sheridan et al. 2022)`, Synapse Detection `Synful(Buhmann et al. 2020)` and Microtubule tracking `Micron (Eckstein et al. 2019)`. We provide access to revived and refactored code via docker containers.
`Pytorch` implementations of the above codebases are WIP.

***PLEASE NOTE THIS IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT. CHECK THE [dev](https://github.com/Mohinta2892/catena/dev) BRANCH!***
